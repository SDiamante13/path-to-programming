# The common software developer predicament 

So maybe you've been at this software developer gig for a little while, and you've finally gotten your code to work the way you want it to.
But, every time you submit a pull request the reviewers send you back to improve your design or test that edge case you missed. Or even worse, your feature clears the code review process only for QA to reject your feature due to bugs you've introduced to the system. 

Imagine you have been working on some new functionality, but have been stuck debugging your code for days and have to get bailed out by a senior dev on your team. Most of the time, that senior doesn't even take the time to explain what you did wrong. They just fix your compilation error and get back to their busy day. What if I were to tell you there is a better way? Would you be interested in trying it for yourself?

# Write fewer bugs

Test-First Development

Follow one rule:

Write a failing test before you write the code

This helps you clarify what your intentions are 
You are more likely to cover all the test cases

What to test? Try ZOMBIES


# Improve your code design

If you are having the following problems:

Everytime I read code I've written from a week ago I can't understand it
I'm not sure how to produce maintainable software
The tests I'm writing are getting in my way, I try to change the code and all the tests break

Then, Test-Driven Development is your solution!

Introduces the refactoring concept

# Where do I start?

TDD katas: FizzBuzz, Leap Year, and Acronym Generator to start
OO design: Mars Rover, Tic-Tac-Toe, Game of Life
Challenge: Do not write production code first, without writing a test.
Measure: Take a measurement of the bugs you are currently producing and compare them after 3 months of trying this.
