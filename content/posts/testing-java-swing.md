# What to expect

This article focuses on how to add automated tests to a Java Swing application. We will talk about the project I used to test against, discuss the library that makes this testing possible, and show many examples.

# Working with Legacy Code

Recently I have been reading "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" by Michael Feathers. I am interested in refactoring and testing, but I haven't worked extensively on codebases without tests. So I thought I would try to work on an old codebase that I coded when I was starting out my development career.

# Application Overview

The first Java project I ever developed is called Diamante Investments. It is a desktop application using the Java Swing framework. Back in those days I didn't know about automated testing so there were no tests initially. My goal in revisiting this project is to learn more about refactoring legacy code. I will be adding sufficient test coverage and refactoring the code in a way that it will be easy to understand what the code is doing.
